### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by [Jialiang Sun(js5951)]

+ Project summary: [In today's life, ideology has become an indispensable part of life. It is precisely because of the difference in ideology that our way of dealing with life and the way of thinking about problems are different. Therefore, the quantitative analysis of textual data on philosophy may be a topic worthy of consideration. This article will use python to ask questions about philosophers, philosophical schools, and the philosophical discourse itself and the possible relationships between them. And use the knowledge of data analysis with relevant data to give analysis and answers.
